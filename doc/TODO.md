# TODO

1. (Done) Expand the summary doc (summary.md) creating one file with additional design considerations for each topic (language, target platform, compiler and tools). These design file must contain an evaluation of possible alternatives, with rationale supporting to choice of the chosen one.
2. (TODO) Added a consideration about testing: review the documentation (especially language design and support tools) to take into account testing
3. (TODO) Create a language tutorial to explain the language, complete with typical usage examples. The tutorial must separately address the data presentation part (page creation) from data manipulation part (functions, chains, external calls).
